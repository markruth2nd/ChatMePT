# ChatMePT
Try 2 for my chatGPT app so I can deploy my app

Original project which I was not able to deploy due to uploading node modules etc and breaking code by too much deleting, pushing, copying & pasting etc I have kind of started from scratch so I can fully submit and deploy my project. This shows I still have much learning ahead of me when it comes to github.
